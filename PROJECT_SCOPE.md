# Project Scope

## Overview
This project delivers a responsive Healthcare Management System UI that helps
hospitals and clinics manage patients, appointments, doctors, and medical
records. The focus is on a clean, accessible interface with modular React
components and Tailwind CSS styling.

## What Was Built
- Responsive dashboard with summary cards and a patient visit trend placeholder.
- Patient management table with search, status filter, and action controls.
- Appointment scheduling list and a creation modal with validation placeholders.
- Doctor management view showing specialization and availability.
- Patient details page with profile data and tabbed sections.
- Reusable UI components, consistent layout, and navigation via React Router.
- Mock API layer with sample JSON data, plus loading and empty states.

## How The Scope Was Implemented
- React functional components with hooks for state and effects.
- Tailwind CSS for layout, typography, and accessible color palette.
- Reusable components for cards, badges, tabs, modals, and states.
- Placeholder API calls and validation to prepare for backend integration.

## What I Plan To Develop Next
- Connect to a real backend API for live data.
- Add authentication and role-based access control.
- Expand forms with full validation (schema-based).
- Add auditing, notifications, and reporting modules.
- Build deployment pipeline and production-ready builds.

## Out Of Scope For Now
- Backend services, database schema, and infrastructure automation.
- Production monitoring, logging, and analytics integrations.
