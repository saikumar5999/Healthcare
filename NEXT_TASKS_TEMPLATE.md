# Next Tasks Template

Paste this into a new request to continue development.

```
Continue the Healthcare Management System project in C:\Users\madil\IdeaProjects\untitled7.

Context:
- Frontend UI is in /frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind.
- Screens already built: Dashboard, Patients, Appointments, Doctors, Patient Details.
- Mock data and placeholder API calls exist in frontend/src/data and frontend/src/api.
- Routing is set up in frontend/src/App.jsx.

New goals:
1) [Describe new feature/module here]
2) [Describe any UI changes]
3) [Describe backend/API integration]
4) [Describe tests or docs updates]

Constraints:
- Keep existing design style and folder structure.
- Use React functional components + hooks.
- Use Tailwind CSS.
- Add loading/empty states and validation placeholders if needed.
- If you need new files, add them in /frontend/src and explain why.

Optional:
- If you need me to run commands, do it yourself.
- If any manual steps are needed from my side, list them step-by-step.
```
